Overview
========

    ``This, is an example of a header README.md, the aim is to briefly describe with a few sentences what the repository does.``
    ``This is heavily based on what Lee did for PK-WL before he left and it was very efficient for other devs to pick up from where he left``

This very simple repository aims to create a template for documentation
(README & DocStrings) for Euclid-SGS Projects.
