SHE_Pipeline 0.4.4
======================

1) Description

This project contains definitions, configurations, and scripts for running pipelines related to shear estimation.

2) Installation

This project does not need to be built, but for the contained scripts to function most easily, it must
be extracted into the directory /home/user/Work/Projects/SHE_Pipeline, otherwise the manual run scripts
must be passed the location of the contained scripts directory as the first argument.

3) Dependencies

The pipeline depends upon the following common tools projects (on the Dev branch of cvmfs):

- Elements v5.2.2
- EuclidDmBindings v2.2.1
- DMTools v2.2.1
- MDBTools v2.2.1

Additionally, the following projects must be installed to run the analysis pipeline:

- SHE_PPT v0.8 - https://gitlab.euclid-sgs.uk/PF-SHE/SHE_PPT
- SHE_MER v0.2 - https://gitlab.euclid-sgs.uk/PF-SHE/SHE_MER
- SHE_CTE v0.6 - https://gitlab.euclid-sgs.uk/PF-SHE/SHE_CTE

4) Execution - Outside Pipeline Runner

Prior to execution, the location of the work directory, including all input files, must be
pointed to with the proper environmental variable within the file "set_analysis_envvars.sh".
The names of all input files relative to the work directory must similarly be set up.

The pipeline can be run independent of the pipeline runner by using the bash script
"run_manual_analysis_pipeline.sh" contained within the scripts directory. If the package is not
installed in the default location, the location of this scripts directory must be passed as the
first command-line argument (e.g. as "./run_manual_analysis_pipeline.sh $PWD" if running from
within it).

5) Execution - With Pipeline Runner

Prior to execution, the file "analysis_isf.txt" within the params directory must be modified to
point to the location of this project, the work directory, and the names of all input products
and listfiles. Then, if the project is not installed in the default directory, the file
"run_analysis_pipeline.sh" in the scripts directory must be modified to point to the location of
analysis_isf.txt. run_analysis_pipeline.sh can then be executed to invoke the pipeline runner.
(It is also possible to manually invoke the pipeline runner, if you are familiar with the commands
for it.)
